# Cofee-Order-Android-App
This is my first android app (and my first coding project ever) that I implemented with the android nano degree on coursera. It's a very simple app but it has some logic and programming in Java.

#### App Use
- The app consists of a single layout (page) from which you can select how many coffees you want, provid your name and add toppings if you like.
- You'll be able to see the price of your order due a button "*calculate*" so you know before you submit your order.
- When you submit, you'll be taken to your gmail app (or any mailing app) with the autofilled email ready to go to your favourite coffeeshop.

#### App Tech
- This app is implemented by the use of xml and java with the understanding of the 'Buttons Click Listeners', 'Intents', and some basic xml elements.
- And of course the app is developed on android studio.
